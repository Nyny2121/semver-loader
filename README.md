# Semantic Versioning Build Loader
This is a quick PHP script I made to automatically load the latest version of my Unity project on my website. It searches a specified builds folder, which is expected to be made of subfolders named with a semantic versioning pattern. My use case for it was so that I could quickly drop all my builds onto my website without having to delete anything, as well as being able to directly access older builds if I wanted, while having my main page automatically load the newest one.
